# Double-description-LNN (DD-LNN)

## Note

- This code includes a soft constrained modification using Lagrangian multiplier from original DD-LNN in the paper to handle multiple LNN inputs in a single node.

  The paper proposes learning rules with the recently proposed LNN. Compared to others, LNNs offer strong connection to classical Boolean logic thus allowing for precise interpretation of learned rules while harboring parameters that can be trained with gradient-based optimization.
